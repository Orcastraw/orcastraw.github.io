            <p>in 2024 i conduced a nearly year long effort to investigate and record myself crashing every zelda game with glitches. its a series i very much enjoy, and have spent years speedrunning and researching, and hoped i could find ways to poke holes in every entry to have a clickbaity, exciting, extravagant claim to made, (and succeeded).

            <p>i spent all of 2024 making friends and breaking these games, and it was very cool to be autism about zelda for a year and have it be a successful cool thing that also made me rent money!!</p>
